        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a recipe that I found on online. It was made by Pillsbury.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box of Pillsbury pie crust (2 count)</li> 
            <li>6 cups of thinly sliced, peeled apples</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</li>
            <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li> 
            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
